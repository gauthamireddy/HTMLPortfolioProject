    <h3>So, Here's something about me!</h3>
    <p>
      I am a User Interface Engineer living in Philadelphia,PA,working on an e-commerce platform.I like to make cool and creative designs regardless of what medium I'm working in.
      I believe in being precise and straightforward both in the products I design and in my everyday life.Travelling to different places helped me able to adapt to new people and cultures.Strong passion for making things simpler and improving lives with technology is the reason why i am drawn to User Interface Design.
      I love my work and enjoy each new project as I get it,feel free to have a look at my portfolio at http://gauthamigaddam.com and contact me If you think I can be of service to you.
      Thanks for stopping by!
